Amstercats-react - WORK IN PROGRESS -

A site for all my friends in Amsterdam who love cats:

User (React):
// Sign up and create a profile for your cat.
// upload pictures and information about your cat.
// Users can sign in and like pictures from other users.
// The top 3 liked photos will be shown on the front page.
// There will be an overview (index) of all cats with a single profile photo.
// And a show page for a specific selected cat with extra details and pictures.

Admin (TBD):
// In FeathersJS or Rails I will build the backend (with either a MongoDB or PostgresQL) and an admin tool to manage users and content.

About

Creating a basic React frontend for the Amstercats webapp. I will use it to integrate it with both a feathersJS api as a Rails api (seperate).  

This is a personal project aimed at improving my understanding of React and using Chai/Enzyme for testing. I started from the ground up without Redux to make a static frontend only based on state. Later on added props, Redux(store) and reducers. This is on hold until after my holiday. After that my focus will be on making a prototype of the website in React and then integrating it with the backend.  

My first goal is to have a working prototype focused on features and functionality. Styling/design will be the focus after that.
